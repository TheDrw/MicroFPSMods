# MicroFPSMods
At the moment, this is just the base template. This is to improve my gameplay programming skilz. My plans are to do remake some Overwatch character mechanics, some AI things, and something else that I can't of think right now.


If you have suggestions that you'd like to see, message me on [learn.unity](https://learn.unity.com/u/drw-128bu). Please don't ask me about offline/online multiplayer stuff. Mainly because I don't know much about that stuff. This is just for creating/extending out gameplay mechanics/systems on an already existing project. Link to [Unity FPS Microgame template](https://learn.unity.com/project/fps-template).


Currently, trying to make the Tracer skills and refactoring code.
