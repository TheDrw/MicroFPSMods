# MicroFPSMods
At the moment, this is just the base template. This is to improve my gameplay programming skilz. My plans are to do remake some Overwatch character mechanics, some AI things, and something else that I can't think right now.


If you have suggestions that you'd like to see, leave a message in [my discord server](https://discord.gg/wm8hmT). Please don't ask me how to build a complete game. This is just for creating/extending out gameplay mechanics/systems on an already existing project.
